# Functools module

## Memoization
Functools module supports  memoization through  lru_cache decorator. This way you dont need to write memoization code.

In the example adding the decorator `@lru_cache` does the needful. You can also see the cache details with `cache_info`

@[lru_cache Decorator]({"stubs": ["functools_memoization.py"], "command": "python3 functools_memoization.py"})
